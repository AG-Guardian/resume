My personal resume website.

Written in HTML5 and CSS, uses JS to track views with GCP Firestore. Hosted in GCP Firebase and deployed via GitHub Actions.

Also includes Dockerfile for possible future container deployments. Currently hosted using a static storage bucket in Firebase instead to keep costs down.
